Learning Style Identification in MOOC Environment using Machine Learning
Overview
This project focuses on predicting student learning styles in Massive Open Online Course (MOOC) environments using machine learning techniques. The Felder Silverman learning style model (FSLSM) is adopted for its effectiveness in technology-enhanced learning. The study utilizes a diverse dataset comprising various attributes related to student behavior and engagement on an online platform.

Problem Statement
Understanding and accommodating individual learning styles in MOOC environments are critical for providing personalized educational experiences. Accurately predicting a student's learning style based on behavior and engagement patterns presents a complex challenge.

Objective
The objective of this project is to explore and identify key factors influencing learning styles, develop an accurate predictive model using machine learning algorithms, and evaluate its performance. The project seeks to enhance personalized education by leveraging predicted learning styles to optimize learning outcomes and engagement.
